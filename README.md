Does Index move differently on different days of the week?

My interest in Financial markets started 12-13 years back, when I was working at the National Stock Exchange (as a consultant). Seeing the tickers move on the board everyday gives you a feeling of being at the center of things. I thought I saw a general trend where stock prices generally setlled a bit lower on Fridays before the Close and rose back to normal levels again after Monday Open. I had rationalized this internally thinking people would generally square off their positions going into the weekend. But I haven't seen any proof to substantiate this, so decided to test it out.
